I am a senior researcher and lecturer at the [Institute of Software Security](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/) of [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de/). My main research focus stands at the intersection of human-computer interaction and privacy engineering. Particularly, I seek to create technological solutions for supporting the cybersecurity decisions of social network users and software developers. For this, I elaborate on digital nudging applications, their personalization by means of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and ethical issues arising from combining persuasion with AI.

Before joining the Hamburg University of Technology, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de). From January 2020 to October 2021 I was the coordinator of the RTG “User-Centered Social Media” funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Between August 2018 and September 2021 I participated in the H2020 project “PDP4E: Methods and Tools for GDPR Compliance through Privacy and Data Protection Engineering”. In the past, I have worked as a software engineer in Denmark and as an undergraduate research assistant in Argentina.

I am a senior researcher and lecturer (tenured faculty member) at the [Institute of Software Security](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/) of [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de/). My main research focus stands at the intersection of human-computer interaction and privacy engineering. Particularly, I am passionate about people's privacy practices in networked environments, their associated risks, and developing technologies to support information disclosure. For this, I analyse empirical data extracted from software repositories, conduct studies with human participants, and elaborate on machine learning models. I am especially interested in digital nudging applications for privacy and the usability of security-enhancing technologies. 

Before joining the Hamburg University of Technology, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de). From January 2020 to October 2021 I was the coordinator of the RTG “User-Centered Social Media” funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I have taken part of several European projects on privacy and securiy including [PDP4E](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787034), [AssureMOSS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/952647) and more recently [Sec4AI4Sec](https://www.sec4ai4sec-project.eu): Cybersecurity for AI-Augmented Systems. In the past, I have worked as a software engineer in Denmark and as an undergraduate research assistant in Argentina.

Since 2023 I am an associate member of the Research Institute for Socio-Technical Cybersecurity ([RISCS](https://riscs.org.uk)) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). Besides conducting my research, I am involved in multi-stakeholder forums for the discussion of public policies and Internet governance issues. Particularly, in debates concerning the users' right to privacy and control over their private information.
