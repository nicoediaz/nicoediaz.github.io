### Teaching and Supervision

As a lecturer, I actively contribute to the design and implementation of different courses and seminars at both masters and bachellor levels. Here you can find a list of my current teaching activities at `Hamburg University of Technology`. 

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col-12 text-center mt-3">
    <style>
      .custom-image {
        max-width: 95%;
        margin-top: 0 !important;
      }

      @media (min-width: 768px) {
        .custom-image {
          max-width: 80%;
        }
      }
    </style>
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/nico_teach.png" title="Nicolas E. Diaz Ferreyra" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 custom-image" %}
  </div>

##### Supervision
I frequently supervise theses and research projects on topics related to privacy, security engineering, and usability studies. Many of these have then been published as conference and workshop papers in collaboration with students.

I am particularly interested in supervising work on **devoper-centered security** and **secure AI-aided software development**. If you are a student at TUHH seeking for supervision and you are into these topics, then [apply here](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/teaching/thesis).

##### Guest Lectures
I have had the honor of sharing my work by offering guest lectures at internationally renowned academic institutions including the *University of Melbourne*, the *University of Montr√©al*, *Monash University*, *RMIT*, the *University of New South Wales*, and the *University of Paderborn*. Please feel free to reach out for coordinating **prospective guest talks or seminars** at your local institution.
